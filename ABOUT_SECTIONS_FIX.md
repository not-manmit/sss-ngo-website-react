# About Page Sections Mobile Fix

## Problem Identified
The "Our Story" and "Our Approach" sections on the About page were not displaying properly on mobile devices, with layout and spacing issues.

## Root Causes
1. **Grid Layout Issues**: The two-column grid was collapsing to single column but not maintaining proper order
2. **Image Sizing**: Images were too large and not properly constrained on mobile
3. **Content Spacing**: Insufficient spacing between text and images on mobile
4. **Order Management**: The HTML structure had different orders for the two sections

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Grid Order Control (768px - 968px)
```css
/* Ensure proper stacking order on mobile */
.content-grid .content-text {
  order: 2;
}

.content-grid .content-image {
  order: 1;
}

/* For approach section, keep image first */
.approach-section .content-grid .content-image {
  order: 1;
}

.approach-section .content-grid .content-text {
  order: 2;
}
```
**Impact**: Both sections now show image first, then content below on mobile

### 2. Content Spacing Improvements
```css
.content-text {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}

.content-image {
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```
**Impact**: Better visual separation between images and text content

### 3. Image Size Constraints
```css
/* At 968px breakpoint */
.image-box {
  aspect-ratio: 16/9;
  max-height: 300px;
}

/* At 480px breakpoint */
.image-box {
  max-height: 250px;
}
```
**Impact**: Images are now properly sized for mobile screens and don't overwhelm the content

## Visual Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Inconsistent stacking order between sections
- ❌ Images too large on small screens

- ✅ Clear spacing between elements (1rem margins)
- ✅ Better readability and flow

## Testing Checklist

## Technical Details

### CSS Properties Used
1. **order**: CSS Flexbox/Grid property to control visual order
2. **max-height**: Constrains image height on mobile
3. **margin-top/bottom**: Adds breathing room between elements
4. **aspect-ratio**: Maintains 16:9 ratio for images

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **968px**: Tablet layout with 300px max image height

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Edge (latest)
