### Image Container Fixes
1. **Image Box**
   - Changed `aspect-ratio: 1` to `aspect-ratio: 4/3` on mobile for better viewing
   - Added `max-width: 100%` to prevent overflow
   - Reduced `max-height` from unlimited to 350px (tablet) and 280px (mobile)
   - Changed border-radius from 20px to 15px (tablet) and 12px (mobile) for better proportions

2. **About Images**
   - Changed `object-fit: fill` to `object-fit: cover` for better image display
   - Added `display: block` to prevent inline spacing issues

3. **Navigation Arrows**
   - Made arrows always visible on mobile (`opacity: 1`)
   - Changed background to visible yellow (`rgba(255, 210, 63, 0.9)`)
   - Reduced size from 50px to 40px (tablet) and 35px (mobile)

### Text Overflow Fixes
1. **All Text Elements**
   - Added `word-break: break-word` for proper word wrapping
   - Added `overflow-wrap: break-word` as fallback

2. **Content Sections**
   - Reduced padding on mobile to `0 0.5rem` for better space usage
   - Added explicit `width: 100%` to all containers
   - Ensured all containers have `overflow-x: hidden`

3. **Font Size Adjustments**
   - **768px - 968px (Tablet)**
     - Page title: 2.5rem → 1.8rem
     - Section headings: 2rem → 1.8rem
     - Body text: 1.1rem → 1rem
   
   - **< 480px (Mobile)**

     - Body text: 0.95rem → 0.9rem

### Layout Improvements
1. **Spacing**
   - Section padding: 5rem → 3rem (tablet) → 2.5rem (mobile)
   - Reduced gaps between grid items for better space usage
   - Better margins between images and text

2. **Grid Layout**
   - Content properly stacks on mobile (image first, then text)
   - Proper order maintained for "Our Approach" section

3. **Cards (Values, Team, Vision/Mission)**
